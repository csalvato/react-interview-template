`npm start` to start the app
`npm run storybook` to run storybook
`npm test` to run the test suite

Write specs, components and stories in the `src/components` directory.

Start with `Page`, which will render in the react app or in Storybook and expand from there.

Use either the app or storybook, depending on the requirements of the question.

If testing is necessary, write tests in the spec file.
